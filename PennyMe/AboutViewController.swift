            PennyMe makes collecting pennys easier than ever before - anywhere you travel. \n\nView locations of nearby penny machines and explore your favorite destinations. Change the status of the pins and turn PennyMe into your digital penny collection. PennyMe also helps you to navigate to the next machine and provides pictures and more information about each machine. To ease your life, PennyMe can also send you push notifications if you are nearby an unvisted penny machine.  Please help growing our database by uploading pictures, commenting about your experience or adding new machines (long tap on the map). Feel free to send us any feedback, we are two free time developers :) \n\nThis is PennyMe v\(currentVersion ?? "").\n©Jannis Born & Nina Wiedemann (2025)
