**App description**

You enjoy collecting pressed pennys?

This app makes it easier than ever to find the next coin machine - anywhere you travel! Never miss your nearest penny anymore!

PennyMe is an app to help with the collection of pressed pennies. Those neat coins that you can imprint with a picture of a tourist attraction if you turn the crank of the machine.

PennyMe displays all machines worldwide and displays detailed information about a machine upon selection.

Tick off machines you visited to keep track of your collected pennies. Or mark a machine for a later visit.

PennyMe also helps you to easily navigate to any machine. And it shows its address, a picture of the machine and other details.

PennyMe relies on user contributions! Add new machines or report if anything has changed!
